# PyTorch (LibTorch) Backend

The Triton backend for [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). 
You can learn more about Triton backends in the [backend
repo](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend). Ask
questions or report problems on the [issues
page](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/issues).
This backend is designed to run [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html)
models using the PyTorch C++ API. All models created in PyTorch
using the python API must be traced/scripted to produce a TorchScript
model.

Where can I ask general questions about Triton and Triton backends?
Be sure to read all the information below as well as the [general
Triton documentation](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server#triton-inference-server)
available in the main [server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server)
repo. If you don't find your answer there you can ask questions on the
main Triton [issues page](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/issues).

## Build the TensorFlow Backend

Use a recent cmake to build. First install the required dependencies.

```
$ apt-get install patchelf rapidjson-dev python3.6-dev
```

Copy over the LibTorch and Torchvision headers and libraries from the
[PyTorch NGC container](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:pytorch)
into local directories.

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=`pwd`/install -DTRITON_PYTORCH_INCLUDE_PATHS="/opt/tritonserver/include/torch;/opt/tritonserver/include/torch/torch/csrc/api/include;/opt/tritonserver/include/torchvision;/usr/include/python3.6" -DTRITON_PYTORCH_LIB_PATHS="/opt/tritonserver/backends/pytorch"..
$ make install
```

The following required Triton repositories will be pulled and used in
the build. By default the "main" branch/tag will be used for each repo
but the listed CMake argument can be used to override.

* triton-inference-server/backend: -DTRITON_BACKEND_REPO_TAG=[tag]
* triton-inference-server/core: -DTRITON_CORE_REPO_TAG=[tag]
* triton-inference-server/common: -DTRITON_COMMON_REPO_TAG=[tag]
